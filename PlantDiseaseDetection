1. Project Overview:
  This project focuses on Plant Disease Detection from Leaf Images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
  The system classifies different plant diseases based on images of leaves. 
  A Streamlit web application will be developed to allow users to upload images for real-time disease detection.

2. Objectives:
  Develop a CNN model to classify plant diseases based on leaf images.
  Train the model using a labeled plant disease dataset.
  Implement Streamlit for an interactive web interface.
  Optimize the model for fast and accurate inference.
