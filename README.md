**1. Project Overview**

This project focuses on Emotion Detection from Facial Images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
The system will classify facial expressions into different emotion categories based on the FER-2013 dataset. 
A Streamlit web application will be developed to allow users to upload images for real-time emotion detection.

**2. Objectives:**
Develop a CNN model to classify emotions from facial images.
Train the model using the FER-2013 dataset.
Implement OpenCV for face detection before classification.
Build a user-friendly Streamlit app to accept image uploads.
Optimize the model for real-time inference.
